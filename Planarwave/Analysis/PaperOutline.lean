# Formalization map for Theorem 1.6

This module records the dependency order of the proof in de Rijk--van Winden.  It intentionally
contains no replacement theorem or additional hypothesis: every analytic item below is a proof
obligation that must eventually be discharged from the hypotheses in `Challenge.lean`.

The paper proof is being formalized in this order:

1. Proposition 2.1: the transverse Fourier symbol has a simple critical eigenvalue
   `lambda_c ξ = -d_perp * ‖ξ‖² + O(‖ξ‖⁴)` and projection `P_ξ = P_0 + O(‖ξ‖²)`.
2. Lemmas 2.2--2.4: complex-frequency bounds for the longitudinal analytic semigroups.
3. Propositions 3.4--3.5 and Theorem 3.1: contour-shifted kernel bounds and the full semigroup
   decomposition into transverse heat flow along `φ'` plus an `O((1+t)⁻¹)` remainder.
4. Section 4: inverse modulation, the exact perturbation equation, and delayed phase forcing.
5. Section 5: Cole--Hopf estimates and the nonlinear bootstrap.
6. Section 6: continuation of the reaction--diffusion solution and comparison of the forced and
   unforced viscous Hamilton--Jacobi phases.

The imported modules provide the foundational objects for those steps: a Banach space of bounded
uniformly continuous functions, a fixed-domain closed-operator resolvent, the Gaussian heat
contraction, the scalar Cole--Hopf equivalence, and the coordinate splitting used in the theorem.
